We have the IP and the only clue http://10.80.158.20:8080/
  http://10.80.158.20:8080/flag.txt

If we enter in the IP we don't have access to the flag

Isn't not so easy how pretend

Then, we delete /flag.txt in the URL, we got the kitty shop (sticker shop)

Use gobuster to enumerate the ip, with a little lucky we can find hidden directories

While gobuster ir running, we go to check aroung the page 

In the source code find the diretory /static, that's where the images are stored
